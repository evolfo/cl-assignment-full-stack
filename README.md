# Angelo's CitizenLab Assignment

## Running the app

This was built with Ruby on Rails and NextJS. 

To start the back-end, run `rails db:create` to create the database, then `rails db:migrate` to run the migrations, then `rails db:seed` to seed the database, and finally run `rails s` to start the server.
To start the front-end, run `npm run dev`
